Thesis deals with detection and movement recognition from video-sequence.
The main problem lies in finding a suitable sequence of methods from computer vision's field, which could as accurately as possible identify movement of person in praxis.
In the theoretical part, the video databases are described in detail, as well as the methods of recognition from the final solution of this thesis. These methods are Motion History Image, Histogram of Oriented Gradients, Principal Components Analysis, Support Vector Machine.
The implementation is described from the pre-processing of the video through the features extraction to the classification and continuous tests. In the final part of the thesis the results are compared and evaluated with the existing solution.
